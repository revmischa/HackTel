## What is HackTel?
Hacktel is a network of phone systems run by individual hackerspaces. It simply provides a cool way of dialing other participating hackerspaces, nothing more, nothing less.

## What can you do with it?
If you have your own phone exchange, you are only limited by your imagination.

* Set up DIDs (phone numbers) for your hackerspace.
* Hook up your intercom to ring a bunch of phones at once.
* Set up old-school faxing over VOIP.
* Video conferencing. Show off your cool shit to other hackerspaces and make them jealous.
* Conference calling

## How do I set it up?
* Get asterisk source (http://www1.digium.com/en/products/asterisk/downloads). ./configure, make, make install.
* Sample configs are included in this repo.
* Ask to get set up with an account for your hackerspace in `#acemonstertoys` on freenode.

## Coming soon
* This is a work in progress. Suggestions welcome (we accept pull requests).
* Publicly-posted dialplan / phonebook
* Featured awesome extensions
* [ITAD dialing](http://freenum.org)
* Video conferencing / dialing
